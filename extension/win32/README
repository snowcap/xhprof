  WHAT YOU (PROBABLY) NEED
********************************************************************************

- MS VC++ 6 (Professional or Enterprise - cause the required VC++ 6 Processor
  Pack only runs on one of these Versions)

- MS Platform SDK (don't user a newer/younger version then Feb(02)/2003! cause
  later releases are incompatible with VC++ 6) Cause Microsoft don't link to 
  the file active use the links from this site:
  http://wiki.tcl.tk/11970
  
- MS Visual Studio Service Pack 5 - THE PROCESSOR PACK ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH THE
  LATEST SP6 - SO USE THE SP5!)
  http://www.filewatcher.com/m/vs6sp5.exe.136410832.0.0.html
    
- VC++ 6 Processor Pack
  http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60ent/update/6/w9x2kxp/en-us/vcpp5.exe

- UPX (if you are planning to use my deploy.bat)
  http://upx.sourceforge.net/

I'm sure that the sources will also compile on other (free) compilers as well
but I don't know how - cause I don't use one of them.

  CONFIGURATION
********************************************************************************

The file "xhprof.example.dsp" contains the configuration for the "xhprof.dsw"-
workspace.

If you plan to rename and configure "xhprof.example.dsp" manually then you 
should continue reading at step I). If you are plan to use the configure.vbs 
to do the job semiautomatically then continue reading at step II).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I) MANUALLY
   Open the file "xhprof.example.dsw" and replace all occurances of 
   __PHP_SOURCE_FOLDER__ with the path to your extracted PHP-sources (e.g.
   C:\PHP_5.3.3) the PHP-source folder is the folder containing the subfolder 
   win32, TSRM and Zend for example. Then simply rename "xhprof.example.dsw" to
   "xhprof.dsw" and you're done.   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II) AUTOMATIC  
   Simply run the configure.vbs script. It shows you a browser-folder dialog 
   where you select the folder containing the PHP-sources (e.g. C:\PHP_5.3.3).
   The configure.vbs the do the job for you by replacing the placeholders in
   "xhprof.example.dsp" and copying it to xhprof.dsp.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now you can run/open the "xhprof.dsw" workspace with your VC++ 6 IDE and compile
the extension easily. Happy coding.

  DEPLOYING
********************************************************************************

I've build a little batch-tool cause on windows you can't delete files used by 
running services. So it's a bit annoying doing all the needed tasks for testing
a build manually - which means that you must:

1. stop the (Apache) service
2. delete the old extension file from PHP's extension folder
3. copy the new extension file to PHP's extension folder
4. start the (Apache) service again

So if you want to use the "deploy.bat" to do this automatically for you, you 
need to run it with the parameters matching your system.

Create a new empty batch file in the same folder as "deploy.bat" and name it 
e.g. "deploy_debug_at_work.bat" or "deploy_release_at_work.bat" 
(or whatever name you prefer).

After that open it in an editor and insert the following line:
"%cd%\deploy.bat" "__PHP_EXTENSION_FOLDER__" __EXTENSION_NAME__ __APACHE_SERVICE__ __MODE__

and now replace
  __PHP_EXTENSION_FOLDER__        with the folder containing your PHP-extensions
  __EXTENSION_NAME__        with the name of the extension (e.g. php_xhprof.dll)
  __APACHE_SERVICE__     with the name of your apache-service (for start + stop)
  __MODE__              with the mode you compiled (either "Debug" or "Release")
  
For example my "Debug"-deploy file looks like that:
"%cd%\deploy.bat" "D:\php_5.3.3\ext\" php_xhprof.dll Apache2.2_php_5.3.3 Debug
